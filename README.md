# Car-Animation
I have made this project with the help of codewithharry youtube channel and it's simply made for my own learning.
This project is about a basic car animation on a website.
This is made using html css and javascript.
We have created a basic html skeleton for a website and filled it with different pictures and used css to decorate it.
